**Details about product from the user's point of view**
*application_name* is a service that allows you to discover always new operas in the museum, it tries to guess your tastes monitoring the time you spend in a section of the museum, and taking a look at other users activities suggests the next section you could be interested in. You will interact with this product through a web application, that anonimously detects your presence in a section of the museum. It at the beginning of the tour will ask you what are you interested in, so that it can give you a first suggestion, then the user interface will indicate the actual position of the user, and every time he or she will change section, it will suggest the next section to visit.
