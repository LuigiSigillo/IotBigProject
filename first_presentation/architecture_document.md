# Architecture

## General
We are facing the COVID-19 emergency so we do not know if we will test the project also on real boards. For the moment we will use the [IoT-LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info/) environment.

We will use as operating system for the IoT device [RIOT-OS](https://riot-os.org/).

## Bluetooth beacon

## MQTT Broker

## Azure Iot Hub

## Database

## Data Processing

## Web Application

details on the technical aspects of the product/service, including a high-level presentation of the conceptual architecture of the software and hardware components that make up the product/service, a description of the main software/hardware components (e.g., 1 paragraph for each component), how these components interact (e.g., network protocols, APIs used), a network architecture clearly depicting the IoT elements, Edge components, Cloud components, End-user components.
