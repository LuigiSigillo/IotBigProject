# Evaluation

This document defines how this project works in technical point of view and user point of view and analysis them to carry out the result for improve services of system .

 ## Technical point of view ( due to the current lockdown we couldn't deploy the application in real scenario I just define summarize)
 
 ### we must to know which product we will provide that need deadline and tool , etc are requirement.
      
      •Product                                                   Application for Museum
      •Design stage                                        Concept design, Prototyping, programing 
      •Product representation                        Storyboard, Participant’s own device, Application
      •Purpose of evaluation                              find best service alternative for visitor
      •Study location                                  Usability lab, Online  study
      •Participants                                           All visitors of museum 
      •Time restrictions                                 3 months (from assignment to results)
      •Equipment, tools                                Special sensors (IOT) , programing, cloud infrastrucure
      •Skills of researchers                              Programer, familiar IOT system 
      
 ### Why we must to evaluate?
 •To  determine the quality of UX (summative) 

    •Measuring UX, e.g. to get out a score 
    •Requirements fulfilled? Targets achieved? 
    •Comparison of several designs
 •To  find out improvement areas (formative)
 
    •Why does certain UX emerge?
    •What you cannot evaluate, you cannot improve
    
### User experience evaluation:
   Methods to reveal how user feels about your design.
   
   UX evaluation is different from usability evaluation.
   
   User experience:
   
    •How a person feels about using a system 
    •Beyond pragmatic utility and usability 
    •Subjective, holistic, emotional, long-term
  
  User Experience Evaluation Methods Evaluation: 
  
    •Some kind of material being evaluated 
    •Not only understanding user behavior/needs
    •Focus is NOT on inspirational / co-creation methods
    •Part of the iterative design/development process,  resulting in input for the next phase
      
 #### How to evaluate user experience?
 
 There is alot methods to evaluate user experince Also techniques that help to collect experiential data such as 
 
    •questionnaires
    •measuring in the lab 
    •self-reporting during visiting
    •observing
    •etc
    
For this project we ghatering data from user application that how much time they spend in each section and how much time they visited all part in the museum.

For example:
