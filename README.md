# IotBigProject
Build a web application/application that runs on your smartphone. It can suggest the next room you could visit based on the time you have spent in the previous room. This is possible thanks to an IoT device placed in every room, to which your smartphone connects (via beacons, Bluetooth or something else). This IoT device measures how much time your smartphone stays connected to it and sends this data to the cloud. Then through a specific function this data is processed to obtain a suggestion on what is the next room you could visit. This suggestion is based on data taken from the visit of other users. The suggestion is sent to the application on your smartphone every time you change the room.
