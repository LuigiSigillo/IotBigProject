# NextRoom

Our goal is to build a web application that runs on your smartphone. This can change the way in which you visit a museum, and makes you focus more on the pieces of art that you like most. It can suggest the next section you could visit based on the time you have spent in the previous sections.

To try to solve a central problem in these days of the COVID-19 emergency, we try to suggest not only the next section to visit basing on the tastes of the visitor, but also on the less crowded section. In this way we try to split the people, not in a randomic way but basing on their tastes, to avoid crowd in the rooms. If the user doesn't like the suggested section, there is the possibility to ask for other suggestions until he or she finds the most interesting. This is possible thanks to an IoT device placed in every section, to which your smartphone connects via Beacons.

This IoT device measures how much time your smartphone stays connected to it and sends this data to the cloud. Then through a specific function this data is processed to obtain a sorted list of suggestions on what is the next section you could visit. This suggestion is based on data collected by the IoT device from the visit of other users. This take into account also the number of people currently in the rooms, to embrace the social distancing philosophy. The suggestions are sent to the application on your smartphone every time you leave the section.
